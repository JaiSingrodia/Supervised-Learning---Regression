Supervised Learning - Regression


Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (x) variables.
y = x1b1 + x2b2 + ..... + xnbn

Cost function: 1/2m(y_pred - y_actual)*(y_pred - y_actual)

In this method we try to decrease this cost function so as to achieve such a value of variable b1,b2...,bn which renders y_pred close to y_actual
